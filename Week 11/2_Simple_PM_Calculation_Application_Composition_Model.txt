Efforts Calculation - Application Composition Model
---------------------------------------------------

PM = NAP / PROD

Where,

PM = Efforts in Person Months
NAP= Number of Application Points or Object Points
PROD = Productivity as Object Points/Person Months (OP/PM)

Suppose for a project

NAP = 200 OP

Productivity: 
Developer Experience is Nominal & 
CASE Maturity is High

From Table: 

Developer Experience = 13 (Nominal)
CASE Maturity = 25 (High)

Therefore,

PROD = (13+25) รท 2 = 19 OP/ Person Months

Now,

PM = 200 OP รท 19 OP/Person Months

PM = 10.5 Person Months
